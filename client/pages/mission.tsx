          Quality food is difficult, if not impossible to come by, and even if
          you do, you aren't even sure if you are getting what you pay for. I've
          had many issues with sourcing food in the past and still do, from
          people pushing grain-fed meat as grass-fed, to being sold meat that
          sat in a freezer for 2 years. The lack of honesty and accountability
          in the current market for naturally raised animal products has driven
          me to provide people a product they can find their true health with.

          Deceptive marketing is present and usually not recognized. Chickens
          fed corn and soy are labelled as "free range," even organic, having
          you pay a premium for chicken no better than your supermarket. Pork is
          commonly marketed as "Heritage Breed" and "Berkshire" but its the same
          case as with the chickens, low quality meat being advertised as
          premium. Cows are fed corn stalks, advertised as "Grass Fed" and
          "Grass Finished." Fish can be farm raised but if its caught in a
          certain way a few miles off the coast its considered "wild-caught."
          Especially with eggs and dairy, which are even harder to find quality
          anywhere, let alone an online delivery service.{" "}

          We have people come to me every single day asking where they can find
          grass-fed meats, and we honestly don't have a good answer for them
          outside of exploring local options, but from this point moving
          forward, we will be that option. Our meat will be cut better, less
          expensive, and guaranteed to be what it says in the label with no
          misleading sales tactics.

          We will be sourcing meat from farmers raising animals for us to these
          quality standards. Ranging from custom cut beef products that you
          can't get elsewhere, to indigenous preparations of pemmican, the
          original survival food, and perfecting beef jerky with the highest
          quality natural ingredients. A staple such as beef tallow will be made
          with the highest attention to detail, ensuring its rendered at the
          perfect temperature. We will be curing our own bacon, canning fish
          with natural ingredients, making animal-based treats that even kids
          will love. Even a dessert bar made with ancestral ingredients!{" "}

          Sourcing quality products that are what we believe in at an affordable
          price has been an incredible task. Not only this, there is an extreme
          variance from animal to animal, different breeds, locations, all yield
          different results. Through careful observation and quality control, we
          will ensure every single product meets the highest expectations.

          We have observed the nutrient requirements of the general population,
          noting specific vitamins as well as omega fatty acids. In order to
          achieve our goals of providing these nutrients in their most natural
          form we will be sourcing from a variety of locations in order to get
          the highest quality products that aren't only nutritious, they taste
          amazing.

          We know there is a market for quality animal products that aren't
          being met, and we hope to achieve almost every single product that
          people desire.
